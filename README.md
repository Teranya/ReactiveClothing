Our main goal within creating our final product was to create a unique interactive experience focusing on biomimicry and extension of the body. The interaction is not something that relies physically on the user’s surrounds, but relies on their personal reactions and emotions. In order to do so we used the basic p5.js library to generate byte data created by key presses to control colours on a series of neopixels through the Arduino IDE, and a muscle sensor to detect muscle activity using electromyography through three biomedical sensor pads.

Our vision for the project involves a product that goes beyond a personal accessory, or something that is simply fashion. Our wearable is an extension of the body itself, allowing the user to visually display/indicate their emotion (specifically times of stress where the muscles tighten). We did an extensive amount of research and concept development. We focused on looking at nature, and animals that could change their physical form for protection/in attempt at protection. One of our biggest inspirations was the frilled lizard. The flaps of skin that surround the lizard’s head showcase a drastic transformation, making a loud statement.
